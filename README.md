# week-4-game

The user is given a random target number at the start of the game. When the user clicks any of the four crystals they will add points to their score, in this case, their number. If the user matches the target number, their wins increase. If they go over the target number, their losses increase.

The game automatically resets when they win or lose. They will be given a new target number. Also, the value of each crystals changes as well.
